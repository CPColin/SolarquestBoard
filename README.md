# SolarquestBoard
This repository contains the GIMP image files used as source imagery for the Solarquest 1985 board image. It also serves as a list of attributions for the various images of natural and artificial Solar System objects.

## Copyright information
Unless otherwise noted, all source images were in the public domain at the time the GIMP image files were constructed. As derivative works of the original images, the copyright to the GIMP image files belongs to their authors. As of this writing, the sole author is Colin Bartolome and the copyright year is © 2009. The author has released the GIMP image files into the public domain.

## Layout
The layout of the board has been recreated from scratch to match the layout of the original board game, as published by Western Publishing Company and apparently designed by Valen Brost. The current holder of the copyright to the original board layout is unknown, but is likely to be one or both of those two entities or their successors. The adaptation of the layout of the original board should not be construed as an authorization or endorsement by the holder of the copyright.

## The font
The font used is "Eras Ultra," for which Colin Bartolome obtained a license from [Linotype.com](https://www.linotype.com/1574153/itc-eras-ultra-product.html).

## Images used
The following images were used when creating the GIMP image files in this repository:

### Artificial objects

| Object | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space Docks | [NASA](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/gallery/images/station/issartwork/html/jsc2006e43510.html) | The highlighted ISS module has been extracted from its image and tinted gold. |
| Research Labs | [NASA Ames Research Center/Don Davis](http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArt/art.html) "AC76-0525" | The torus has been extracted from its image and its dimensions and colors have been modified. |
| Federation Stations | [NASA Ames Research Center/Don Davis](http://settlement.arc.nasa.gov/70sArt/art.html) "AC76-0525" | The torus has been extracted from its image and its dimensions and colors have been modified. A red dome and green desk has been added, to distinguish the Federation Stations from the Research Labs, which use the same source image. |
